# PromineoTechFinalCodingProject
# Dance Dance Revolution Song Database
## Executive Summary:
This project is a current database of the official Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) songs in existence. The main intention of this project is it’s a specified database for the current DDR songs where users can find information about DDR songs and comment under each song (essentially leaving a review).
For the purposes of this project, I’ll only be implementing songs from the current version of the game (DDR A3) as there are over 1,000 DDR songs in existence.
